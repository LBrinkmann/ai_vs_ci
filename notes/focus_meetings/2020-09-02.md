# Interesting questions

*   Is there a limit in the capacity to coordinate?
*   Some large entropy signal, with low entropy for us
    *   All agents share a hidden seed of a random number generator
    *   On each step all agents get a correlated number
*   Agents could somehow identify each other (and then learn a hidden language)
    *   Agents could learn how to identify each other

# Conclusions

* having a end-to-end AI is not first priority
* random number generator can be easily be implemented
* maybe it would be great to have more metrics to investigate behaviour
