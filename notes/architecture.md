# Overview

## Steps

### High Level
* propose architecture
* select existing environment with 
    * multi agent
    * discrete action space
    * cooperation / competition
    * implementation of proposed architecture
* reimplement 
* build infrastructure 
    * training on cluster
    * tensorboard (oa)

## architecture
* GRU policy
* shared weights on / off
* learning schema
    * q learning
