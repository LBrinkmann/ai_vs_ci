# Resolved Technical questions

We want the system to be on the stable side. For this reason we might rather go
for relative slow target updates and large horizon. Large and very small batch
sizes seem to not work so well, for that reason we might want to settle on a
intermediate value there.

Suggestion:

- horizion: 100
- target update 50
- batch_size: 10

Implemented in `madqul_slow_v2`.

# Open Technical questions

We want the smallest, most simple architecture, the smallest hidden size and the
simplest pooling, which still does not compromise the complexity and diversity of the observed pattern.

In terms of qualitive differences we might expect:
architecture > pooling > hidden size

Hidden size however have the largest impact quantitatively, and might be a
manipulation later on.

Order of checks:

1. architecture
2. pooling
3. hidden size

Currently I am very interested into local aggregation and stable networks and
will hence use those for the moment. I will increase the number of nodes to 40
as for stable networks size might matter, and 20 might be on the low side.
